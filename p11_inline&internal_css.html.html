<h1 id="Lin">Linkedin</h1> 
<p> 
The best part? Publishing on the platform is completely free. You don’t have to buy a domain name, pay for ads o 
r anything else to boost your exposure – all you need to do is sign up for an account and start sharing content and ma
 
king connections.<br> 
 
LinkedIn users are always looking for more information related to their industry or niche, so you have the opport 
unity to show them what you know and position yourself as an authority in your field.<br> 
LinkedIn is all about building relationships, and you can build strong and meaningful ones by providing your con 
nections with real value. You can build credibility and trust and connect with other bloggers in your niche, opening t
 
he doors to more opportunities for growing your business.<br> 
 
Now, you can publish content directly on LinkedIn just like you do on your blogging platform, but you can also s 
hare your blog posts. This means that you can use LinkedIn to increase lead generating traffic to your blog.<br> 
 
You can attract a lot of people interested in what you have to say and, after reading a few high-quality articles on 
the platform, they will be compelled to check out your blog and learn more about you. Whenever you publish a new 
 
article, your connections will receive a notification, so they will never miss out on your awesome content.<br> 
 
Also, on LinkedIn, sharing is caring. Your connections will share your articles with their audience if they find the 
m relevant and interesting, helping you expand your reach even more. Then, their connections will read and share th 
em and head to your blog as well. This is why using LinkedIn as a blogging platform is an opportunity you definitel 
y shouldn’t miss.

s launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon. which hosts the s 
ource code of our project in any of the programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made by a de 
veloper. GitHub on the web gives us the backup of what we have done, allowing us to collaborate with others and to 
 
publish what we have done to share it with the outside world.<br> 
 
GitHub is an online Git repository hosting service, which provides a web-based graphical interface, that allows 
us to synchronize our source code/project store locally into the web. We can also use GitHub to browse other people 
’s repositories and download code or documents hassle-free. GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. It allows
 
us to create a public or private repository, where the public will be available over the internet to the world and privat 
e is limited and only viewable by the repository owner.
